                            Determined to bridge the gap, he established this academy with the goal of delivering 
                            American Standards in swimming coaching, right here in Chennai. Tragically, he passed 
                            away in 2021 due to COVID-19 and was not able to see through the end of the journey. 
                            But today, we proudly carry forward his vision and follow in his footsteps — committed to 
                            continuing the legacy he began.
